# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Giveback Project Proposal (Orange Cohost) 

## Name of the Project  "College Events Hubs" 
<br><br>
## Why this project 
- This project will help college students get easy access to the events that happen at their colleges. <br>
- It will also be up to date with any news. <br>
- Students can comment on those events. It also has a study group option.  <br>

## What problem/challenge does this project address? How does this project address the problem? 
- Right now, my college event page only shows the upcoming events, but there are not many options that we can do. The only book which events we want. <br>
- Most of the time students focus on their academic courses, so many times that they want to try to join events at the university, but they need to go to many links. Some events linked are not updated. <br>
- Many immigrant students lack information on where they can expand their networking, connect to the university community, and stay informed in general. 

<br>

## What are the specific intended outcomes for this project? How will the success of this project be measured? 
- Help students join the events easily. We can measure how many active accounts are on the system.<br>
- We will track the number of students that join the events and feedback from students who use the app.<br>
<br> 

## How many people do you think this project will impact? How will people be impacted by this project?
- If we assume that our own university use this app by next year Approximately 10 %. That means there will be around  6700 students total in our team colleges. <br>
- Students will be able to enjoy attending community & campus events by getting connected directly, first-time students will have more opportunities, immigrant students will have more opportunities to get a job, recruiters have more opportunities to connect with students, and other resources can reach more students. <br>

## What do you need to do to execute this project? 
- Finishing following the timeline project. <br>
- Frontend Development: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React  for building dynamic user interfaces. <br>
- Backend Development: Choose a suitable backend framework like Node.js. Use databases like MySQL. <br>
- Hosting: Platforms like Heroku/GitHub for deploying your website. <br>
- Design: Tools like Figma  for creating wireframes and mockups. <br>
- Schedule Meetings/Work Times: notion.so, excel sheet, Slack, email, and mobile phone <br>

## Who will this project affect? 
- College students ( more aim to help immigrated students including financial aid ) <br>
- College administrators, Scholarship providers, companies'/industry recruiters
