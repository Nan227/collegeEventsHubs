## What problem/challenge does this project address? How does this project address the problem? 
- Right now, my college event page only shows the upcoming events, but there are not many options that we can do. The only book which events we want. <br>
- Most of the time students focus on their academic courses, so many times that they want to try to join events at the university, but they need to go to many links. Some events linked are not updated. <br>
- Many immigrant students lack information on where they can expand their networking, connect to the university community, and stay informed in general. 

<br>

## What are the specific intended outcomes for this project? How will the success of this project be measured? 
- Help students join the events easily. We can measure how many active accounts are on the system.<br>

<br> 

## How many people do you think this project will impact? How will people be impacted by this project?
